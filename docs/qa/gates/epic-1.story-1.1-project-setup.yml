# QA Process notes
process_notes: |
  Excellent team response to QA feedback. All identified issues were systematically 
  addressed with comprehensive solutions. The team not only fixed the immediate 
  concerns but established a robust testing foundation for future development.

  This represents a model example of collaborative quality improvement, turning 
  potential technical debt into solid test infrastructure.

# Risk assessment - significantly reduced
risk_summary:
  overall_risk: 'LOW'
  technical_debt: 'MINIMAL'
  production_readiness: 'EXCELLENT'
